            Vuetify is a complete UI framework that is based on Vue.js and complies with the Material 
            Design (MD) specification. This means that the core functions of both Vue and Material are
             available by default and can be improved by both communities. The goal is to provide
              developers with tools to create rich and engaging designs and user experiences. Vuetify
               is easy to learn and provides hundreds of carefully crafted components from the MD
                specification. It supports all modern browsers and is compatible with Vue CLI-3. It
                 also provides basic templates for Simple HTML, Webpack, NUXT, PWA, Electron, A La
                  Carte, Apache Cordova.</v-card-text>

            Of course, that also means that you have to take on the MD with Vuetify. If you develop an app exclusively for IOS or have to rely completely on your own design, Vuetify is not the
      right decision. So also with Vuetify the rule remains the same: first analyze the requirements
       of the project, then select the UI framework.
